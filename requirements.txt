# Audio Processing Pipeline Requirements

# Core AI enhancement
clearvoice

# Audio processing and analysis
numpy>=1.24.0
scipy>=1.10.0

# FFT acceleration - CPU fallback (always install)
pyfftw

# API server dependencies
fastapi
uvicorn
python-multipart

# Optional: GPU acceleration (NVIDIA GPU with CUDA 12.x only)
# Uncomment the appropriate line based on your CUDA version:
cupy-cuda12x  # For CUDA 12.x
# cupy-cuda11x  # For CUDA 11.x
# If installed, the pipeline will automatically use GPU acceleration for spectral processing

# No additional requirements needed - FFmpeg is assumed to be installed system-wide
# Install FFmpeg separately:
# - Ubuntu/Debian: sudo apt-get install ffmpeg
# - macOS: brew install ffmpeg
# - Windows: Download from https://ffmpeg.org/download.html
